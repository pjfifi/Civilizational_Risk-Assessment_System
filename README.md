# Early Warning System for Outbreak Detection

This project aims to develop an Early Warning System (EWS) for outbreak detection by integrating data from multiple sources. The system is designed to process diverse datasets, engineer relevant features, train robust machine learning models, and evaluate their performance using a variety of metrics, including those specific to business needs. The ultimate goal is to detect early signals of emerging outbreaks before they become widespread and to generate actionable alerts.

# Features
- Expanded Data Integration: Designed to handle data from multiple heterogeneous sources, including:
    - Syndromic Surveillance Data: Internet search trends (e.g., Google Flu Trends), social media mentions of symptoms, news reports of unusual illnesses.
    - Weather and Climate Data: For predicting vector-borne disease outbreaks.
    - Mobility Data: Human movement patterns (anonymized mobile data, travel statistics).

- Modular Design: Separate modules for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

- Reproducibility: Configuration file (config.yaml) for managing experiment parameters.

- Robust Data Splitting: Proper train/validation/test splits to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

- Class Imbalance Handling: Strategies to address imbalanced datasets common in outbreak detection (e.g., scale_pos_weight, weighted loss, sampling techniques).

- Advanced Feature Engineering: Utilizes modern techniques to create impactful features, including those derived from text and time-series data.

- Diverse Model Support: Includes LightGBM, Neural Networks, and a placeholder for AI API integration, now expanded to include:

    - Time Series Forecasting: To predict future case numbers or disease activity.

    - Anomaly Detection: To identify unusual spikes in reported symptoms or news mentions.

    - Natural Language Processing (NLP): To analyze text from news, social media, or medical reports for early signs of disease.

    - Deep Learning (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks - RNNs or Transformers): For complex time-series and sequential data.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Implements methods for optimizing model hyperparameters.

- Comprehensive Evaluation:

    - Precision-Recall curves

    - ROC curves

    - Standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

    - **Business-specific metrics (placeholder for custom metrics relevant to outbreak detection).

- Output: An alert system that flags potential emerging outbreaks based on real-time data.

- Version Control: Recommended use of Git for tracking changes and collaboration.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/early_warning_system.git
cd early_warning_system

(Note: Replace https://github.com/your-username/early_warning_system.git with your actual repository URL)

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Place your raw data:
Put your raw data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) into the data/raw/ directory. The data_processing.py module will be set up to read from here. Ensure you have data for syndromic surveillance, weather/climate, and mobility if you plan to use those features.

How to Run
To execute the entire pipeline, from data processing to model evaluation:

python main.py

You can modify parameters in config/config.yaml to experiment with different settings, models, or feature engineering techniques.

Configuration
The config/config.yaml file allows you to customize various aspects of the pipeline:

data_paths: Paths to raw data files, now including syndromic, weather, and mobility data.

preprocessing: Settings for data cleaning and merging, including text preprocessing.

feature_engineering: Parameters for feature creation, including NLP features and advanced time-series features.

data_split: Ratios for train, validation, and test sets.

class_imbalance: Strategy for handling imbalanced classes.

models:

lightgbm: Hyperparameters and training settings.

neural_network: Architecture and training settings.

ai_api: Placeholder for API keys or endpoints.

time_series_forecasting: Configuration for time series models.

anomaly_detection: Configuration for anomaly detection algorithms.

deep_learning_sequence: Configuration for RNNs/Transformers.

evaluation: Paths for saving plots and reports.
