Civilizational Risk Assessment System
This project aims to develop a system for Civilizational Risk Assessment, identifying regions or societies at increased risk of systemic failure. It integrates data from diverse sources related to environment, economy, governance, and social cohesion. The system is designed to process these heterogeneous datasets, engineer relevant features, train robust machine learning models, and evaluate their performance using a variety of metrics, including those specific to business or policy needs. The ultimate goal is to provide early warnings of potential systemic risks.

Features
Data Integration: Designed to handle data from multiple heterogeneous sources relevant to civilizational risk, including:

Environmental Data: Climate change indicators, resource depletion, natural disaster frequency.

Economic Data: GDP growth, inflation, unemployment rates, debt levels, income inequality.

Governance Data: Corruption indices, political stability, rule of law, government effectiveness.

Social Cohesion Data: Social unrest indicators, demographic shifts, health disparities, education levels.

News & Reports: Textual data from global news outlets and analytical reports for qualitative insights.

Modular Design: Separate modules for data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Reproducibility: Configuration file (config.yaml) for managing experiment parameters.

Robust Data Splitting: Proper train/validation/test splits to ensure unbiased model evaluation.

Class Imbalance Handling: Strategies to address imbalanced datasets (e.g., scale_pos_weight, weighted loss, sampling techniques), common when predicting rare systemic failure events.

Feature Engineering: Techniques to create impactful features, including time-series trends and NLP features from textual reports.

Machine Learning Models:

LightGBM: A robust gradient boosting model for classification or regression.

Neural Networks: For complex pattern recognition in tabular data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Implements methods for optimizing model hyperparameters (e.g., using Optuna for LightGBM).

Comprehensive Evaluation:

Precision-Recall curves

ROC curves

Standard classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

Business/Policy-specific metrics (e.g., cost of false alarms vs. cost of missed risks).

Output: A system that flags potential systemic risks for regions or societies.

Version Control: Recommended use of Git for tracking changes and collaboration.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/civilizational_risk_assessment.git
cd civilizational_risk_assessment

(Note: Replace https://github.com/your-username/civilizational_risk_assessment.git with your actual repository URL)

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Place your raw data:
Put your raw data files (e.g., CSV, JSON) into the data/raw/ directory. The data_processing.py module will be set up to read from here. Ensure you have data for environmental, economic, governance, and social cohesion factors.

How to Run
To execute the entire pipeline, from data processing to model evaluation:

python main.py

You can modify parameters in config/config.yaml to experiment with different settings, models, or feature engineering techniques.

Configuration
The config/config.yaml file allows you to customize various aspects of the pipeline:

data_paths: Paths to raw data files, now including environmental, economic, governance, social, and news data.

preprocessing: Settings for data cleaning and merging, including text preprocessing.

feature_engineering: Parameters for feature creation, including time-series trends and NLP features.

data_split: Ratios for train, validation, and test sets.

class_imbalance: Strategy for handling imbalanced classes.

models:

lightgbm: Hyperparameters and training settings.

neural_network: Architecture and training settings.

evaluation: Paths for saving plots and reports.
